Version in **[🇪 Español](README.es.md)** 

A comprehensive repository for learning system design concepts through practical implementations and real-world examples.

## What is System Design?

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It involves making high-level decisions about how different parts of a system will interact, how data will flow, and how the system will scale to handle increasing load.
