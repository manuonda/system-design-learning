A comprehensive repository for learning system design concepts through practical implementations and real-world examples.

## What is System Design?

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It involves making high-level decisions about how different parts of a system will interact, how data will flow, and how the system will scale to handle increasing load.

### Key System Design Concepts

- **Scalability**: Designing systems that can handle increased load
- **Reliability**: Building fault-tolerant systems that continue operating despite failures
- **Availability**: Ensuring systems remain operational and accessible
- **Consistency**: Managing data consistency across distributed systems
- **Performance**: Optimizing for speed and efficiency
- **Security**: Implementing proper authentication, authorization, and data protection
- **Caching**: Improving performance through strategic data storage
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing requests across multiple servers
- **Database Design**: Choosing appropriate data storage solutions
- **Microservices**: Breaking down monolithic applications into smaller services
